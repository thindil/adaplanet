## General information

Here you can find all modified files for the [Ada
Planet](https://www.laeran.pl/adaplanet) RSS aggregator.

Generally, whole project is made from two parts:

1. [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/) as a frontend.

2. [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) to convert some
   content to RSS (or filter existing RSS feeds).

If you have any questions or propositions about Ada Planet feel free to open

be added to the Planet.

And that's all for now, as usual I probably forgot about something very
important :)
