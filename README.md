## General information

Here you can find all modified files for the [Ada
Planet](https://www.laeran.pl/adaplanet) RSS aggregator.

Generally, the whole project is made from two parts:

1. [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/) as a frontend.

2. [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) to convert some
   content to RSS (or filter existing RSS feeds).

If you read this file on Github: **please don't send pull requests here**. All
will be automatically closed. Any code propositions should go to the [Fossil](https://www.laeran.pl/repositories/adaplanet)
repository. If you have any questions or propositions about Ada Planet feel free to open
[ticket](https://www.laeran.pl/repositories/adaplanet/tktnew) there. You can also use
the project tickets or forum to propose links which should be added to the Planet.

And that's all for now, as usual I probably forgot about something very
important :)
