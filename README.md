## General information

Here you can find all modified files for the [Ada
Planet](https://www.laeran.pl/adaplanet) RSS aggregator.

Generally, the whole project is made from two parts:

1. [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/) as a frontend.

2. [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) to convert some
   content to RSS (or filter existing RSS feeds).

**INFO:** This project is no longer maintained. Feel free to clone it and take
care about it.

## Legal

All code in **FreshRSS** directory is under GPL v3 license.

All code in **RSS-Bridge** directory is in public domain.

And that's all for now, as usual I probably forgot about something very
important :)
